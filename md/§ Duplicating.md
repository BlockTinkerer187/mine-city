# Duplication

## What is duplication?
Duplication is the act of using a machine (such as a redstone contraption) or game glitch to create copies of illegitimate items. Duplication may result in an instataneous ban.


## Legality
Considering that duplication is able to create *duplicates* of **any item**, duplicating will result in a **PERMENANT REALM BAN.** If you know of duping and do not report it, you are considered an *accomplice*.


### Reporting
If you know that someone is duplicating, please report it. If duplicating goes unnoticed for a long period of time, it may result in a new world being generated.
